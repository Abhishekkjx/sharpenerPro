# Expense Tracker App

The Expense Tracker App is a simple web application that allows users to track their daily expenses. Users can add an expense by providing the name, amount, and date. The app dynamically displays the list of expenses and enables users to delete any expense as needed. This version of the app operates in-memory, so data will reset upon page reload. The app is styled using Bootstrap for a modern and responsive UI.

# Features

Add Expense: Users can input the name, amount, and date of an expense to add it to the list.

Delete Expense: Remove any added expense by clicking the delete button.

Dynamic Updates: The expense list updates dynamically without refreshing the page.
